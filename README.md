# stablediffusion-experiments

This repo is currently just the equivalent of google drive for my code.
I'm writing various test harnesses to explore the formats of stable diffusion models,
and related entities.

Note: "dictionary" is a paired-down version of /usr/share/dict/words.
It was neccessary to make a modified one, to remove  "'s" type words,
and also case-sensitive varients.
This file is now appropriate for use with CLIP Tokenizer experiments
